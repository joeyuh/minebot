# minebot

Bot that beat the minesweeper game. Works at minesweeperonline.com. Not sure if it works with the Windows XP one, but it should. Absolutely no guarentee, however.
It did beat the game in 25 second on http://minesweeperonline.com. All time record under name joeyuh.

Know issue or potential problem:
Expert level only
Seem to only work in Chrome
You are not able to control your mouse until the program give up after a number of trails
When you do beat the game, the program will exit with an error
Haven't test on all platform, but should support macOS, Windows, and Linux

# This version is highly developmental, and I strongly recommend not running it if you don't understand the code
